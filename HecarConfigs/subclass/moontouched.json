He sought power, and so all that was Holy spurned him. So, he sought something else that was near-Holy, the Moon, something he thought would accept him. What he found was something... Other. Something that blessed him, in its own peculiar way. Something that accepted him, but in its acceptance, it left his mind altered, touched by something more powerful and more dangerous than he could ever know.",
